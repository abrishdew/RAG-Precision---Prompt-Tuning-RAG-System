# Precision RAG: Prompt Tuning For Building Enterprise Grade RAG Systems
***

### Project Overview

In the evolving field of artificial intelligence, Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have become crucial for various applications. Their effectiveness, however, heavily depends on the quality of the prompts they receive, leading to the emergence of "prompt engineering" as a key skill.

Prompt engineering is the craft of designing queries or statements to guide LLMs to produce desired outcomes. The challenge lies in the sensitivity of these models to prompt nuances, where slight variations can yield vastly different results. This poses a significant hurdle for users, especially in business contexts where accuracy and relevance are paramount.

The need for simplified, efficient prompt engineering is clear. Automating and optimizing this process can save time, enhance LLM productivity, and make advanced AI capabilities more accessible to a broader range of users. The tasks of Automatic Prompt Generation, Test Case Generation, and Prompt Testing and Ranking are aimed at addressing these challenges, streamlining the prompt engineering process for more effective use of LLMs.

### Project Guide 
First of all, public LLMs, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Bard have been trained on publicly available data, which has two important implications. They are not able to capture information released after their training cut-off and they did not have access to non-public or company-specific data during their training. Consequently, these models are missing out on essential and up-to-date information and context, making them a not-so-ideal solution for the automatic generation of text where company-specific information is required. 
For the Using the Principles of RAG we are going to design a method to enhance an LLM’s information retrieval capabilities by drawing context from external documents. However, in certain use cases additional context is not enough. If a pre-trained LLM struggles with summarizing financial data or drawing insights on some specifically queried data,  it is hard to see how additional context in the form of a single document could help. 
In such a case, fine-tuning is more likely to result in the desired output. Moreover, In the assignment we will be fine tuning a RAG model so it can generate an automated and optimized satisfactory prompt to produce desired outcomes.

### Workflow 
The flow will be directed in such a way that a user states their desires (in terms of data) and how they want to interact with the RAG system or the output necessity. (Could be a dialogue, chat or a one-time question, summary- which in our case would be deciding to use RAG-Token or RAG-Sequence).
Finally we are opted with the option to either allow a prompt from the user and evaluate (analyze) that prompt from the user or just accept the parameters or desired instructions and generate prompts they should use in their RAG system.

### Approach and Technique

Using the method of context learning, a new data has been handed in, we will take in that input and store it in a vector database so it is embedded and ready for the next steps. The data will be chunked and converted into n-dimensions(Vectored). That will be fed to the LLM(Large Language Model) where the LLM will generate a Natural Language back to us with an answer (in this case a set of prompts or An evaluation of the prompt, depending on the user’s desire). Through our back end, we will be going through Automatic Evaluation Data Generation Service using RAGAS and Prompt Testing and Ranking Service using Monte Carlo Matchmaking and ELO Rating System.
So to implement this we have several steps to follow including 
* Define the problem and the solution.
* Design the architecture and the interface.
* Implement the code and the logic.
* Test and debug the application.
* Deploy and monitor the application.
* Iterate and improve the application.
