# Precision RAG: Prompt Tuning For Building Enterprise Grade RAG Systems
======
### Project Overview
------
In the evolving field of artificial intelligence, Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have become crucial for various applications. Their effectiveness, however, heavily depends on the quality of the prompts they receive, leading to the emergence of "prompt engineering" as a key skill.

Prompt engineering is the craft of designing queries or statements to guide LLMs to produce desired outcomes. The challenge lies in the sensitivity of these models to prompt nuances, where slight variations can yield vastly different results. This poses a significant hurdle for users, especially in business contexts where accuracy and relevance are paramount.

The need for simplified, efficient prompt engineering is clear. Automating and optimizing this process can save time, enhance LLM productivity, and make advanced AI capabilities more accessible to a broader range of users. The tasks of Automatic Prompt Generation, Test Case Generation, and Prompt Testing and Ranking are aimed at addressing these challenges, streamlining the prompt engineering process for more effective use of LLMs.
